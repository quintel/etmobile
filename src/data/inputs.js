          happening right here. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.
          Let's put a touch more of the magic here.

          Let's get wild today. Trees grow however makes them happy. But they're
          very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. We spend so much of our life
          looking - but never seeing. They say everything looks better with odd
          numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the
          critics.

          We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Now let's put some happy
          little clouds in here. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Let your
          imagination be your guide. Just think about these things in your mind
          - then bring them into your world.
