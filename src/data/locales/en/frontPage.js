  etmDescription: `
    <p>
      The climate is changing as a result of human activity, principally due to
      greenhouse gas emissions. The most famous of these is carbon dioxide
      (CO<sub>2</sub>) which results from burning fossil fuels such as coal,
      oil, and natural gas. It is clear that in order to address this, these
      energy sources must be replaced with sustainable alternatives such as wind
      and solar. However, we cannot change immediately from one to the other;
      we are too dependent on fossil fuels for our energy supply and prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is is therefore very important that we focus on the core of the problem in
      the transition to a CO<sub>2</sub>-neutral energy supply: CO<sub>2</sub>
      emissions. This means that we need to determine which alternatives will
      have the best impact. In the short-term it is good to replace the most
      polluting fuels – such as coal – with cleaner alternatves. Consuming less
      energy is of course by far the smartest options; nothing is cleaner than
      unused energy. In the long-term, changing human behaviour and emerging
      technologies – such as batteries and electric cars – may also have a
      significant positive effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this game we investigate which technologies and decisions will reduce
      emissions most. You will receive options at a time and should choose which
      will have the greatest effect. After each question you may tap the
      question mark at the top of the screen to find out why one option is
      better than the other.
