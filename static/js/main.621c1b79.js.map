However, we cannot change immediately from one to the other;\\n      we are too dependent on fossil fuels for our energy supply and prosperity.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Is is therefore very important that we focus on the core of the problem in\\n      the transition to a CO<sub>2</sub>-neutral energy supply: CO<sub>2</sub>\\n      emissions.

In the short-term it is good to replace the most\\n      polluting fuels \\u2013 such as coal \\u2013 with cleaner alternatves.

The most famous of these is carbon dioxide\n      (CO<sub>2</sub>) which results from burning fossil fuels such as coal,\n      oil, and natural gas. It is clear that in order to address this, these\n      energy sources must be replaced with sustainable alternatives such as wind\n      and solar. However, we cannot change immediately from one to the other;\n      we are too dependent on fossil fuels for our energy supply and prosperity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Is is therefore very important that we focus on the core of the problem in\n      the transition to a CO<sub>2</sub>-neutral energy supply: CO<sub>2</sub>\n      emissions. This means that we need to determine which alternatives will\n      have the best impact. In the short-term it is good to replace the most\n      polluting fuels – such as coal – with cleaner alternatves. Consuming less\n      energy is of course by far the smartest options; nothing is cleaner than\n      unused energy. In the long-term, changing human behaviour and emerging\n      technologies – such as batteries and electric cars – may also have a\n      significant positive effect.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      With this game we investigate which technologies and decisions will reduce\n      emissions most. You will receive options at a time and should choose which\n      will have the greatest effect. After each question you may tap the\n      question mark at the top of the screen to find out why one option is\n      better than the other.\n    </p>\n  `,\n\n  playGame: 'Play the game'\n};\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/data/locales/en/frontPage.js","export default {\n  correct: 'Correct',\n  difficulty: '{mode} difficulty',\n  difficultyEasy: 'Normal',\n  difficultyMedium: 'Challenging',\n  difficultyHard: 'Expert',\n  incorrect: 'Incorrect',\n  title: '{firstChoice} or {secondChoice}'\n};\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/data/locales/en/game.js","export default {\n  all: 'All-time high scores',\n  anon: 'Anonymous',\n  loading: 'Loading leaderboard',\n  noPlayers: 'No players yet!',\n  playerNameDescription: `\n    This is how you will appear on the leaderboard.
