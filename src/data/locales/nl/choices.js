    description: `
      You can build 250 wind turbines of 3 MWe each. Wind turbines produce
      less electricity per MWe than fossil-fired or nuclear plants do because
      of varying wind conditions. Offshore wind turbines produce at maximum
      capacity ~40% of the time, if there is not too much need for maintenance.

      You can close a conventional 800 megawatt electric (MWe)
      ultra-supercritical pulverized coal-fired plant. These plants are not
      build anymore in rich countries due to environmental restrictions. The
      Netherlands still possesses 1,200 MW of production capacity from this type
      of power plant.

      You can close a modern 800 megawatt electric (MWe) ultra-supercritical
      pulverized coal-fired plant. Of all types of power plants, coal and
      lignite-fired contribute most to pollution of the environment. This is the
      most common type of modern coal-fired power plant in rich countries, with
      relatively strict regulations for air pollution.

      Trucks need to drive longer distances and sometimes have less time to

      These cars use less than half the energy from ‘well to wheels’ of good
      diesel cars and are even more efficient compared to gasoline engines.
      They are emission free, which is a bonus to the environment in our cities
      and villages!

      New cars become almost 2% more efficient every year. To reduce

      Green gas is biogas that has been upgraded to natural gas quality and can
      be fed into the gas mains. Biogas is conventionally produced by bacteria
      that digest biological material. In the future, such gas may be produced
      by ‘gasification’ of biomass.

      Newly built houses – namely those build after 1990 – already have a higher
      degree of insulation than older homes. In general, they have been built
      with cavity walls containing insulation, insulated glazing, roofs and
      floors. What if we insulate these houses further to their maximum

      The most important insulation measures are roof, wall, floor insulation,

      of houses that were built before 1990?

    description: `
      This heater is a combination of an electric heat pump that draws its heat
      from the outside air and an efficient conventional gas-fired boiler.
      Essentially, the hybrid heat pump offers a way to strongly reduce natural
      gas demand for heating, while buying time for grid management companies to
      reinforce grids.

      Compared to diesel ships an LNG ship has a 50% advantage in its emissions
      of sulfur particles, and a 60% advantage in particulate matter. Because of
      methane slip at the ship's engine, the CO<sub>2</sub> difference is very
